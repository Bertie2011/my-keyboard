# Kyria rev2.0 - splitkb.com
As a programmer I need to be able to type comfortably for many years. To avoid RSI related problems in the future, I wanted to stay ahead and get a more ergonomic keyboard. It was perfect timing, because I was transitioning from a laptop to a gaming PC at the same time, so I needed a new keyboard anyways.

## Material List
Although I got the rev 2.0 kit, these are the components you'll need if you wanted to build a similar style using the rev 3.0 kit.

* [Kyria rev3 PCB kit](https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-kits/products/kyria-rev3-pcb-kit), no RGB underglow, no RGB backlight, with a set of OLED displays, Choc/MX Hand solder
* 2x [Pro Micro Controller](https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-parts/products/pro-micro-atmega32u4-5v-16mhz), the space ended up being quite limiting especially if you want to enable most QMK features and have RGB/OLED animations. For my purposes, being a beginner of QMK and keeping everything quite simple it had just enough memory. Do check out the [Liatris Controller](https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-parts/products/liatris) with 16 MB of memory compared to only 32 KB on the pro micro.
* [Controller Sockets without pins](https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-parts/products/mill-max-low-profile-sockets), adding sockets should allow for easy removal of controllers in case they break.
* 5x [10x Kailh Low Profile Choc Switches](https://splitkb.com/collections/switches-and-keycaps/products/kailh-low-profile-choc-switches?variant=33100108234829), I got the Pro Red linear switches. Make sure you get about 55 switches for the 50 key keyboard, a few extras are good to have.
* 5x [10x 1u Blank MBK Choc Low Profile Keycaps](https://splitkb.com/collections/switches-and-keycaps/products/blank-mbk-choc-low-profile-keycaps?variant=31811491987533), on top of the 50 1u black keycaps I also got 2 sets of 2x 1u homing keycaps (for both index fingers and both thumbs).
* [Braided TRRS Cable](https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-parts/products/braided-trrs-cable?variant=31226379468877)
* Micro USB to USB A cable for a Pro Micro controller or a USB C to USB A cable for the Liatris controller
* [Low Profile Case](https://splitkb.com/products/kyria-rev3-low-profile-case), consisting of black Top Plate and Bottom Plate (without Puck holes), Tinted OLED Cover and a Case Hardware Kit.
* [Pair of Crystals Gel Flexible Wrist Rest](https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-parts/products/crystals-gel-flexible-wrist-rest), which can also be used as make-shift tenting solution :)
* [Keycap and Switch Puller](https://splitkb.com/products/switch-and-keycap-puller?variant=33314105753677)
