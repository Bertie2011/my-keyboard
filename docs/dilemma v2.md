# Dilemma V2 - Bastard Keyboards
Since getting my first split keyboard I never stopped trying to optimize my keymap to the point that the most noticable discomfort was having to switch over to the mouse every now and then. I tried mouse keys, but could never get used to them so I started looking at the keyboards offered on bastardkb.com. The OLED displays were only used for layer/mod indicators, which I thought would be easier to spot if the keys themselves lit up as indicators with RGB. Throw in rotary encoders which I didn't have before and the decision was made.

## Material List
If you want to build this keyboard yourself, here's what you need:
* [Dilemma Kit](https://bastardkb.com/product/dilemma/), with 2x Rotary encoders (MX), Frost case and Per-key RGB.
* [4mm Opal White Acrylic top plates](https://kunststofplatenshop.nl/product/plexiglas-opaalwit-4-mm/), these plates have a light transmittance of 32% and have been designed by myself. You can view the plate files [here](../dilemma%20v2%20top%20plate/).
* [Akko CS Lavendar Purple Switch (Lubed, 45pcs)](https://akkogear.de/en/products/akko-cs-lavender-purple-switch-lubed-45pcs), a light tactile switch. Akko has a US based website too.
* 2x [10 pcs Gateron Switches](https://aliexpress.com/item/32791600556.html), I got white/clear gateron switches which are light linear switches. I put these on the thumb keys and the two outer columns, with the purple Akko switches everywhere else.
* 2x [25 pcs Ymdk DSA 1u keycaps](https://aliexpress.com/item/4000354001038.html), I got the Fog coloured keycaps. In theory you only need 34 keycaps, but a few keycaps extra is always nice and a set of 50 didn't cost much more.
* [4 black knobs](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B015IGMWTC?language=en_GB&th=1), these actually didn't fit the 6 mm shaft on the rotary encoders because of the plastic housing inside. I could expand the inner diameter with some course sandpaper though.
* [Black 4 pin 3.5 mm jack cable of 0.5 meters](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B00EKZR9ZK?language=en_GB), also known as a TRRS cable.
* [1m USB C to USB A cable](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07K4J6HJ3?language=en_GB)
* [12 LouMaxx Rubber Buffers](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B08GKP4311?language=en_GB), on each half I put 2 stacks of 2 buffers underneath the inner column/thumb cluster to cause the keyboard to tent (tilt outwards horizontally).
