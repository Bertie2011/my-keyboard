# Dilemma V2 - Bastard Keyboards
Since getting my first split keyboard I never stopped trying to optimize my keymap to the point that the most noticable discomfort was having to switch over to the mouse every now and then. I tried mouse keys, but could never get used to them so I started looking at the keyboards offered on bastardkb.com. The OLED displays I had before were only used for layer/mod indicators, which I thought would be easier to spot if the keys themselves lit up as indicators with RGB. Throw in rotary encoders which I didn't have before and the decision was made.

## Material List
If you want to build this keyboard yourself, here's what you need:
* [Dilemma Kit](https://bastardkb.com/product/dilemma/), with 2x Rotary encoders (MX), Frost case and Per-key RGB.
* [3mm Opal White Acrylic top plates](https://kunststofplatenshop.nl/product/plexiglas-opaalwit-3mm/), these plates have a light transmittance of 32% and have been designed by myself. You can view the plate files [here](../plate%20files/dilemma%20v2%20top%20plates/).
* [Akko CS Lavendar Purple Switch (Lubed, 45pcs)](https://akkogear.de/en/products/akko-cs-lavender-purple-switch-lubed-45pcs), a light tactile switch. Akko has a US based website too.
* 2x [10 pcs Gateron Switches](https://aliexpress.com/item/32791600556.html), I got white/clear gateron switches which are light linear switches. I put these on the thumb keys and the two outer columns, with the purple Akko switches everywhere else.
* [DES keycaps](/DES%20keycaps), I had them printed by [JLCPCB](https://3d.jlcpcb.com/3d-printing-quote) in 8111X Resin with sanding.
* [4 black knobs](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B015IGMWTC?language=en_GB&th=1), these actually didn't fit the 6 mm shaft on the rotary encoders because of the plastic housing inside. I could expand the inner diameter with some course sandpaper though.
* [Braided TRRS Cable](https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-parts/products/braided-trrs-cable?variant=31226379468877) and [Set of 90Â° Angled TRRS Adapters](https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-parts/products/angled-trrs-adapter)
* [1m USB C to USB A cable](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07K4J6HJ3?language=en_GB)
* [Set of 2 Pack Foldable Feet for Keyboard Notebook](https://www.amazon.nl/-/en/Laptop-Riser-Foldable-Keyboard-Notebook/dp/B0C68V47ZT), although I currently have 1 stand on each side, I would recommend buying 2 pairs for added stability.
