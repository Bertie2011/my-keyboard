# Aurora Corne V1.1 - splitkb.com
With frequent moving of the keyboard between home and work, the rotary encoders were the first to break. I also didn't get much use out of the trackpad, since it requires lifting your hand and at that point you might as well reach for the mouse. A break in the audio jack connections was the final straw. It was time for a new keyboard and I have been wanting a 6th column for a while, so coming from a trusted vendor, the choice for the Aurora Corne was made.
