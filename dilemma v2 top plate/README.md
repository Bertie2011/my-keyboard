# Top Plate Files
My first keyboard had acrylic plates between the PCB and the key switches. I wanted to achieve the same thing with the Dilemma, so I designed new plate files.

Some **important** notes:
* The plate files are untested.
  * I ordered an earlier revision with a miscalculated trackpad cut-out and had to remove one of the trackpad legs. The files have been adjusted and *should* fit now.
* These files are for the Dilemma V2 from bastardkb.com
* Cut-outs have been made for the keys, TRRS jack, reset button, case screws and the trackpad, but other features like the DBG/IO/LCD/I2C headers and the tenting puck mounting holes will be covered.
* You must order one of each file
* The plates should be about 4mm thick
* Make sure to check whether the plates are glossy/mat on both sides. If they are glossy on one side and mat on the other, you will have to mirror one of the files.
* :warning: Solder the reset button before adding the plate and switches!
* :warning: Insert the case screws (**with** spacers on other side) before adding the plates and soldering switches.
  * The holes are big enough to fit a hex key in, but you cannot pass screws through the plates.
  * Don't forget that the left side will need an extra flat headed screw + spacer in one of the trackpad mounting holes, because it won't be occupied by the trackpad holder. Reference the bottom case print for mounting points. You won't be able to access this screw after adding the plate.
  * Make sure to tighten the spacers on the other side of the PCB for each of the screws before continuing.
