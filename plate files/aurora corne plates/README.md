# Custom Aurora Corne Plates

These files have been sourced from the [SplitKb repository](https://github.com/splitkb/aurora/tree/master/Aurora%20Corne).

Modifications:
- The bottom plate with added kerf still had the pre-kerf lines, which I removed.
- Removed the puck hole on the bottom plate
- Removed the puck mounting points on the top plate and restored the switch holes.
- Increased the mounting point radius from 1mm to 1.5mm, because that were the requirements of the acrylic cutting company I used.
  - :warning: In hindsight, the holes are barely small enough to prevent the vendor-provided screws from passing though. If you can, I would recommend shrinking the holes back to 1mm radius.
- Removed the two mounting points between the ring finger and pinky columns, because after making them bigger I deemed them too close to some of the switch holes.
