# Custom Aurora Corne Plates

These files have been sourced from the [SplitKb repository](https://github.com/splitkb/aurora/tree/master/Aurora%20Corne).

Modifications:
- The bottom plate with added kerf still had the pre-kerf lines, which I removed.
- Removed the puck hole on the bottom plate
- Removed the puck mounting points on the top plate and restored the switch holes.
- Increased the mounting point radius from 1mm to 1.5mm, because that were the requirements of the acrylic cutting company I used.
  - :warning: In hindsight, the holes are barely small enough to prevent the vendor-provided screws from passing though. If you can, I would recommend shrinking the holes back to 1mm radius.
  - Using these files with MX switches requires you to use 8mm spacers (less wobbly case, but the screws might fall out during transport) or 12mm spacers (tight screws, but plates are able to wobble up and down a bit) from the SplitKb hardware kit.
  - If you use 12mm spacers (10x) you won't have enough for the OLED covers if you got those in your kit. You do have enough 8mm spacers if you decided to use OLED covers without displays, even if you use 8mm spacers for the plates already. 
- Removed the two mounting points between the ring finger and pinky columns, because after making them bigger I deemed them too close to some of the switch holes.
