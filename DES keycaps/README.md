The keycaps I'm using have a DES profile. The original design files are hosted at [pseudoku/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles](https://github.com/pseudoku/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles), which were then exported as STL, touched up and uploaded at [sporkus/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles](https://github.com/sporkus/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles). I opened the STL files in Microsoft 3D Builder and "repaired" them, they are just here for reference in relation to my builds.
