The keycaps I'm using have a DES profile. The original design files are hosted at [pseudoku/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles](https://github.com/pseudoku/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles), which were then exported as STL, touched up and uploaded at [sporkus/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles](https://github.com/sporkus/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles). I made some modifications so that I could order them from a resin printing service online.

Modifications:
- After opening them in the often already installed Microsoft 3D Builder app, I clicked on the popup that appears to "repair" each of the files.
- Added some supports for resin prints.
- Combined models of various files together for the Corne expansion file.

After printing, cleaning up any left-over supports is easiest by taking some scissors and placing each leg on either side of one of the keycap walls underneath the support strands. Then use the scissors as a lever to push the support material off. Optionally sand the bottom of the keycap afterwards.

## File combinations
By printing or ordering certain combinations of files you can get yourself a full keycap set.
